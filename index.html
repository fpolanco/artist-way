      The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron
    </h2>
    <p>The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path To Higher Creativity is a 1992 self-help book by American author Julia Cameron. The book was written to help people with artistic creative recovery, which teaches techniques and exercises to assist people in gaining self-confidence in harnessing their creative talents and skills. Correlation and emphasis is used by the author to show a connection between artistic creativity and a spiritual connection with God.

        The ideas in creative personal development outlined in the book, which were felt to be new at the time of the publication, are said to have become a phenomenon and spawned into many meetups and support groups throughout the world. The group meetings are based on a 12-week creativity course designed for people to work through and gain artistic inspiration, as outlined in the book. The program is focused on supporting relationships in removing artistic blocks and fostering confidence.</p>
    <p>On JS Bin, I purposedly includes the stylesheet on the HTML tab (instead of separate CSS tab) for easier code reading for those with small screen.</p>
    <p>The <code>main</code> element is placed within a <code>div</code> element along with <code>nav</code> and <code>aside</code>. I don't know if this is right or wrong (let me know?).</p>
    <p>Navigation links are placed within <code>nav</code>, laid on the left. The <code>main</code> is at the center column (this column). Within it is the main topic (this article).</p>
    <p>The <code>aside</code> element is at the rightmost of the column, I put supplemental information on it.</p>

    <h2>Reviews</h2>
    <p>“Without The Artist's Way, there would have been no Eat, Pray, Love.”
        —Elizabeth Gilbert
        
        "The Artist's Way is not exclusively about writing—it is about discovering and developing the artist within, whether a painter, poet, screenwriter, or musician—but it is a lot about writing. If you have always wanted to pursue a creative dream, have always wanted to play and create with words or paints, this book will gently get you started and help you learn all kinds of paying-attention techniques; and that, after all, is what being an artist is all about. It's about learning to pay attention."
        —Anne Lamott
        
        "This is a book that addresses a delicate and complex subject. For those who will use it, it is a valuable tool to get in touch with their own creativity."
        —Martin Scorsese</p>
